The reason I chose this question is due to my curiosity about reclining seats on airplanes, a topic that has sparked many debates with my friends. There are no strict rules about etiquette on planes, which raises many questions about passenger behavior. The ![chart](7Nwml-given-the-opportunity-would-you-eliminate-the-possibility-of-reclining-seats-on-planes-entirely-.jpg) shows that the majority of those surveyed, who provided an answer, would not choose to eliminate the option to recline seats. Reading and considering these responses made me rethink my own behavior at airports.
